He moved to Nokia Indonesia in 1995 as RF Engineer. Briefly in Nokia, Hisar decided to move to Ericsson Indonesia on 1996. With Ericsson he became the RF manager (1997). At Ericsson Hisar strived to increase the competences of the local engineers with the understanding that solutions to RF issues are tightly related to the local knowledge, geographical local knowledge as well as social local knowledge. Ability to communicate with local operators RF Engineers are also one important key for successful RF Service delivery. During the regional economic problems in 1998 Hisar has managed to provide many trainings for him and his RF Engineer team by working in various projects in Singapore, Taiwan, Turkey, Israel and Spain.
